### Encoding vs Encryption

**Encoding** transforms data into another format using a scheme that is publicly available so that it can easily be reversed.

**Encryption** transforms data into another format in such a way that only specific individual(s) can reverse the transformation.

For Summary -

- **Encoding** is for maintaining data usability and uses schemes that are publicly available.

- **Encryption** is for maintaining data confidentiality and thus the ability to reverse the transformation (keys) are limited to certain people.
